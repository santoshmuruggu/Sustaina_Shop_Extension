## Features

### üîÑ Real-time Product Scoring

SustainaShop analyzes products and displays a sustainability score (0-100%) based on four key factors:

- **üåø Brand Ethics Score**: Evaluates the brand's sustainability commitment using our ethical brands database
- **üöõ Shipping Eco Score**: Calculates the carbon footprint based on shipping distance
- **üß™ Material Score**: Evaluates the sustainability of product materials
- **üìú Certification Score**: Identifies verified eco-certifications and labels

### üîç Sustainable Alternatives

- Automatically scans related products to suggest more sustainable alternatives with higher eco-scores
- Compares prices and sustainability scores side by side

### üí¨ Sustainability Chatbot

- Built-in AI chatbot powered by OpenAI to answer sustainability-specific questions about products
- Provides personalized advice based on the product context

### üìä Carbon Footprint Insights

- Location-aware shipping distance calculation
- India-specific carbon footprint information
- Visualization of shipping environmental impact
